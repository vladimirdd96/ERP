Internship Experience: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System
During my internship, I undertook the responsibility of conceptualizing and implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. This system aimed to centralize the operations of the company and is currently deployed across two departments: the Software Department and the Marketing Division. Notably, the system is designed for seamless expansion.
User Registration Process:
* 		Administrator Registration:
    * The first user to register assumes the role of an administrator.
    * Required details: admin's name and email.
    * The system generates a password, dispatched via email.
* 		Regular User Registration:
    * After the administrator's registration, users can be registered through the administrative account.
    * The registration form for regular users includes auto-generated passwords sent via email.
User Types:
The ERP system establishes two distinct user types:
* 		Project Managers:
    * Primary role: Creation of projects and tasks.
    * Addition of registered developers to collaborate on projects.
    * Extraction of detailed reports on project work allocation and task specifics.
        * Generation of financial reports for a specified timeframe.
        * Financial report details tracked hours, developer hourly wages, and the company's payment to the developer.
        * A profit/loss report is generated, elucidating earnings versus disbursements for each individual.
* 		Developers:
    * Access to assigned tasks.
    * Ability to alter task statuses and track hours for engaged tasks.
